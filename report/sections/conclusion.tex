\section{Conclusion}
This report dedicated to solves the minimal surface problem with obstacle with linear finite element approximation. We transform the minimal surface problem into a unconstrained optimization problem while considering the obstacle problems as a constrained optimization problem. In response to the two mentioned problems, we implement several unconstrained and constrained optimization algorithms and thoroughly analyze the experimental results respectively. It shows that Newton method has the best perfomance in the minimum surface problem while projected gradient method behaves well to solve obstacle problems. Furthermore, we propose experimental observations and several extentions and application scenerios, which shows great practical prospect.
